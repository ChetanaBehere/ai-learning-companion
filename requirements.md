# Requirements Document

## Project Title
AI Learning Companion for Computer Science Students

## Vision
To build an intelligent AI-powered learning companion that enhances conceptual understanding, coding productivity, and structured preparation for Computer Science students.

## Problem Statement
Despite the availability of online learning platforms, students still struggle with:
- Understanding complex concepts in Data Structures and Algorithms
- Receiving personalized feedback on code
- Identifying weak areas in competitive and academic preparation
- Maintaining structured and consistent study habits

Most platforms provide static content rather than adaptive, AI-driven guidance tailored to individual learning needs.

## Proposed Solution
An AI-based noting that:
- Explains concepts in structured, step-by-step format
- Generates practice problems dynamically based on skill level
- Analyzes user-submitted code for correctness and optimization
- Tracks learning patterns and suggests personalized improvement plans

## Target Users
- Undergraduate Computer Science students
- Competitive programming aspirants
- GATE aspirants
- Beginner and intermediate developers

## Core Objectives
1. Improve conceptual clarity
2. Increase coding productivity
3. Provide intelligent performance insights
4. Enable structured learning with AI assistance

## Functional Requirements

1. User Authentication and Profile Management
2. AI-powered Concept Explanation Module
   - Simplified explanations
   - Complexity analysis
   - Step-by-step breakdowns
3. Dynamic Practice Question Generator
   - Difficulty-based generation
   - Topic-specific questions
4. Code Review and Optimization Engine
   - Logical error detection
   - Time & space complexity analysis
   - Improvement suggestions
5. Performance Tracking Dashboard
   - Topic-wise strength analysis
   - Progress metrics
   - Study recommendations

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Response time under 2 seconds
- Secure authentication and data handling
